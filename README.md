# MTB - Media Transfer Bot

MTB is a software tool that scrapes video resources and pipes them directly to a server via Discord bot.
### Features
- **Resource Protection Bypass:** Download video resources with normally inaccessible files (e.g. Instagram, YouTube).
- **Optional server upload:** The user may choose to leave files in their local directory or set the bot to upload automatically to a server specified in their environment.
- **Automated File IO:** Handles file organization and transfers automatically.
